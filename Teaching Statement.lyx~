I consider teaching as the best profession.
 It provides ample opportunity for noble action like learning and teaching
 for whole life.
 I love to learn things and teach them to the student.
 The profession is noble and requires lifelong learning.
 It requires enthusiasm, dedication and overall great motivation to be a
 great professor.
 I have that zeal, and I am ready to undergo the hardship required to be
 a good professor.

\noindent
Further, I believe that learning is a self-driven process, and a teacher’s
 role involves is more than just facilitating learning and imparting knowledge
 to the students.
 A teacher should provide motivation to the students to learn and help in
 organizing their thought process to understand and develop skills necessary
 to be successful in professional and personal life.
 A teaches should also help students to develop creative and critical thinking
 to build solutions to real-life engineering problems and become a successful
 engineers.
 Since, Engineering is a “problem-solving discipline” that requires an understan
ding of the basic principles/axioms of nature and their role in formulating
 the underlying mathematical models.
 I believe that teacher should not compromise on mathematical rigor and
 physical insight required to address the problem to be solved.
 One can first start with the explanation of physics and then introduced
 to the mathematical tool to complete the particular difficult topic to
 the students.

Slide preparation, assignment preparation and illustration are three other
 things that teacher should give its effort, creativity, and customization
 to make the concept properly understood by the students.
 If possible, available or self-rendered video clips about the topic or
 physical phenomena can be shown to better recalling in the mind.
 One more skill that can help any teacher to success his/her mission of
 imparting knowledge is that skill of typeset, illustration, and publishing
 the content on the website so that student can focus on the studying of
 the topic instead of writing to make noted for themselves.

Some more points which I personally feel can be done (according to the rules
 of the institute) by keeping the interest of the students is to open to
 the review sessions, flexible schedule, website communication which provides
 students way to ask their doubts.
 All the above mentioned points can easily be executed as these above points
 require patience and passion to our subject which I feel I have.

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
Feedback during class or outside the class in the form of queries or doubt
 is very much essential for teachers.
 So that, teacher can understand where to repeat or explain in different
 way.
 A simple MCQ type questions can be given to students for a weekly progress
 of the students.
 The idea of doing all these things is to make students think and develop
 question and reasoning about the topic which ultimately build their confidence.

To make the student grasp the subject and understand the conceptual nuances,
 I would like to follow the following pedagogy techniques:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
\noindent
Sharing the slides with students, so that they can get the idea about that
 is going to be taught in the lecture.
 Further, this will help student to just focus on the understanding of the
 concept instead of note making.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
\noindent
Giving the outline of the topics and how topics are interrelated.
 Particularly, how present topic is interlink with previous topic or why
 this we are studying present topic.
 Is present topic an essential element for particular topic or anything
 other? So that, a continuously is maintain as done in other subject like
 History.
 A historic perspective can also be given which help students to understanding
 the subject in better way.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
\noindent
Teaching the theoretical topic using slides, presentation, and black/white
 board.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
\noindent
Demonstration of concept through prototype model (if possible) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
\noindent
Solving the numerical problems.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
\noindent
Solving same problem or different problem using suitable programming/scripting
 language.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
\noindent
Finally, software training like ANSYS or ABAQUS.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
\noindent
Whenever possible, importance of topic for different platform (GATE exams
 or job interview) will be highlighted.

The Further, as a teaching assistant, I have tutored several under graduate
 and Post-graduate student at the IIT Kharagpur.
 The subject in which I have been the teaching assistant are as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
\noindent
Engineering Mechanics 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
\noindent
Finite Element Method 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

Apart from teaching assistant, I have mentor several undergraduate, post-graduat
e, and early PhD students during my stay in IIT kharagpur.
 I have also conducted workshop or training sessions on MATLAB and
